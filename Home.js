          Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia, a general term for
          memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere
          with daily life. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of dementia
          cases. Learn more: What is the Difference Between Dementia and
          Alzheimer's?, What is Dementia, Research and Progress Alzheimer's is
          not a normal part of aging. The greatest known risk factor is
          increasing age, and the majority of people with Alzheimer's are 65 and
          older. Alzheimer disease is considered to be younger-onset Alzheimer
          if it affects a person under 65. Younger-onset can also be referred to
          as early-onset Alzheimer. People with younger-onset Alzheimercan be in
          the early, middle or late stage of the disease. Learn more:
          Younger/Early-Onset Alzheimer's, Risk Factors Alzheimer's worsens over
          time. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, where dementia symptoms
          gradually worsen over a number of years. In its early stages, memory
          loss is mild, but with late-stage Alzheimer's, individuals lose the
          ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment.
          On average, a person with Alzheimer's lives 4 to 8 years after
          diagnosis but can live as long as 20 years, depending on other
          factors. Learn more: 10 Warning Signs, Stages of Alzheimer's Disease
          Alzheimer's as a Continuum Alzheimer's disease progresses in stages,
          with the severity of symptoms increasing over time. Select a stage to
          learn more. Alzheimer's has no cure, but two treatments — aducanumab
          demonstrate that removing beta-amyloid, one of the hallmarks of
          Alzheimer disease, from the brain reduces cognitive and functional
          decline in people living with early Alzheimer. Other treatments can
          temporarily slow the worsening of dementia symptoms and improve
          quality of life for those with Alzheimer's and their caregivers.
          Today, there is a worldwide effort underway to find better ways to
          treat the disease, delay its onset and prevent it from developing.
