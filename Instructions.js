          Just like the rest of our bodies, our brains change as we age. Most of
          us eventually notice some slowed thinking and occasional problems with
          remembering certain things. However, serious memory loss, confusion
          and other major changes in the way our minds work may be a sign that
          brain cells are failing. Alzheimer's changes typically begin in the

          through the brain it leads to increasingly severe symptoms, including
